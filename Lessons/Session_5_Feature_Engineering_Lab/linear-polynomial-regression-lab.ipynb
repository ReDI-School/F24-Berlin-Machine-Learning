    "# Task: Building Linear and Polynomial Regression Models for Pumpkin Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: The goal of this task is to build and evaluate linear and polynomial regression models to predict pumpkin prices based on various features. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Solve the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data donwload**:\n",
    "   - Gather a dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usda/a-year-of-pumpkin-prices?resource=download\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Exploration**:\n",
    "   - Load the dataset into a DataFrame (using pandas).\n",
    "   - Inspect the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.\n",
    "   - Check for missing values and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Handle missing values if any are found.\n",
    "   - Convert categorical variables (if any) into numerical format using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y) where `y` is the price of pumpkins.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Create visualizations (scatter plots) to explore the relationship between the features and pumpkin prices. This helps identify trends and the potential need for polynomial features.\n",
    "\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "5. **Split the Data**:\n",
    "   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing) using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Build a Linear Regression Model**:\n",
    "   - Import the necessary libraries (e.g., `LinearRegression` from `sklearn`).\n",
    "   - Create a linear regression model and fit it to the training data.\n",
    "   - Make predictions on the test set.\n",
    "   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Build a Polynomial Regression Model**:\n",
    "   - Import the `PolynomialFeatures` from `sklearn`.\n",
    "   - Transform the features into polynomial features (e.g., degree = 2).\n",
    "   - Create a new regression model using the transformed features.\n",
    "   - Fit the polynomial regression model to the training data.\n",
    "   - Make predictions on the test set and evaluate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Comparison of Models**:\n",
    "   - Compare the performance of the linear and polynomial regression models using the evaluation metrics.\n",
    "   - Visualize the results to see how well each model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Conclusion**:\n",
    "   - Summarize the findings and discuss which model performed better and why.\n",
    "   - Consider the implications of using polynomial features and potential risks of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Extensions\n",
    "- Explore the effect of different polynomial degrees on model performance.\n",
    "- Experiment with other regression techniques, such as Ridge or Lasso regression, for comparison.\n"
