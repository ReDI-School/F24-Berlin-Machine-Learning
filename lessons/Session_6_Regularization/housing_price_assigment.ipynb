    "\n",
    "## Dataset: Boston Housing Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore a dataset of housing prices and use regression to predict house prices based on various features. You will also perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualize the data, and select important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "- Answer the following questions by writing code in the cells below.\n",
    "- Be sure to visualize your findings and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "- Finally, train a regression model to predict housing prices and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Data Loading and Exploration**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1: Load the dataset and inspect the first few rows.\n",
    "- Load the Boston housing dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`) into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "Since the **Boston Housing dataset** is deprecated, you can download the alternative housing dataset from [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Display the first 5 rows to understand the structure of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2: Check for missing values.\n",
    "- Identify if there are any missing values in the dataset. How would you handle them if any exist?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: Describe the dataset's numerical features.\n",
    "- Use `describe()` to get a summary of the dataset's numerical columns.\n",
    "- Which feature(s) have the highest and lowest values? Are there any surprising observations?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4: Visualize the distribution of house prices.\n",
    "- Create a histogram of the house prices. Is the distribution normal or skewed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5: Explore relationships between features and house prices.\n",
    "- Create scatter plots for at least 3 features vs. house prices (target variable).\n",
    "- What relationships do you observe between the selected features and the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6: Correlation Analysis\n",
    "- Calculate the correlation matrix of the dataset.\n",
    "- Based on the correlation, identify at least 2 features that are highly correlated with house prices.\n",
    "- Are there any features that are strongly correlated with each other but not with the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Regression Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7: Split the dataset\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Use an 80/20 split.\n",
    "- Make sure to separate the target variable (house prices) from the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 8: Train a Linear Regression Model\n",
    "- Train a Linear Regression model using the training data.\n",
    "- Evaluate the model's performance on the test data by calculating the Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 9: Feature Importance (Optional)\n",
    "- If using a model like Ridge or Lasso, identify which features are most important in predicting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Conclusion**\n",
    "- Summarize your findings and observations.\n",
    "- Reflect on the regression model's performance and whether there are any improvements you would recommend."
